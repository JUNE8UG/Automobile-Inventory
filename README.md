# Vehicle Inventory Management System

This system is a basic vehicle inventory management tool designed to help users keep track of their vehicle information. It allows users to add new vehicles, delete existing ones, and update vehicle attributes such as make, model, color, year, and mileage. The program utilizes a list of dictionaries to store vehicle data and writes this information to a file (`vehicle.txt`) for persistent storage.

The program is implemented in both Python and Java.

## Features

- **Add Vehicles:** Easily add new vehicles to the inventory.
- **Delete Vehicles:** Remove existing vehicles from the inventory.
- **Update Attributes:** Modify the attributes of vehicles in the inventory.
- **Display Inventory:** View the current inventory in a formatted manner.
- **Persistent Storage:** The program writes and reads inventory information from a text file.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Python program:**
   ```bash
   python vehicle_inventory.py
2. **Run the Java program:
```bash
   javac AutomobileInventory.java
   java AutomobileInventory
```
