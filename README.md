# Vehicle Inventory Management System

This system is a basic vehicle inventory management tool designed to help users keep track of their vehicle information. It allows users to add new vehicles, delete existing ones, and update vehicle attributes such as make, model, color, year, and mileage. The program utilizes a list of dictionaries to store vehicle data and writes this information to a file (`vehicle.txt`) for persistent storage.

The program is implemented in both Python and Java.

## Features

- **Delete Vehicles:** Remove existing vehicles from the inventory.
- **Update Attributes:** Modify the attributes of vehicles in the inventory.
- **Display Inventory:** View the current inventory in a formatted manner.
